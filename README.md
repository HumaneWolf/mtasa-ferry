# MTASA Ferry

This is a resource for the [MTASA](https://mtasa.com/) multiplayer mod for GTA San Andreas. It replaces a bridge in Northern Bone County with a simple ferry.

## Features

* Moving ferry.
* Charges you for taking the ferry.

### Missing features

* Make sure the player can afford the ferry
* Improve gate script: Gates can bug out and not close/open properly.
* Stick cars to the ferry, so the player won't need to accelerate to stay on.

I am not planning on spending time continuing developing the resource, feel free to use or modify according to the licence.
